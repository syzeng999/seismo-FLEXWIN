#This program is used to select window(FLEXWIN), make measurements and calculate adjoint source. There are so many people who contributed to FLEXWIN and Measure_adj. I will add credit soon...

#ASDF Version DEVELOPER: Wenjie Leio
#ORIGINAL DEVELOPER: Alessia Meggia

#-----------------------------
Pre-request:
1) SAC
2) Adios-1.5.0

#-----------------------------
How to run examples:
1) copy test PAR_FILE
    cp PAR_FILE_MAIN.test PAR_FILE_MAIN
2) complie the code
    make clean ; make
3) run the code
    ./FLEXWIN_ASDF

#-----------------------------
How to run:
1 There are at least several Par_file you might be intrested in:
  a) PAR_FILE_MAIN: input file(obsd and synt) and out directory
  b) FLEXWIN/PAR_FILES: Parameter files for flexwin, differetiated by component and period band.
  c) FLEXWIN/src/user_functions.f90: user_functions settings inside. Modify it a little. However, if you look into it, it's very simple. Have to make this modification because we are now working in a different way.

2. make clean;  make

3. ./FLEXWIN_ASDF(you can also submit the job the cluster and run it in parallel, which is the ultimate point of this program. But even you run on 1 processor, you can still get hugh speed up!)

TODO:
1) modify Makefile
